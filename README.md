# ¡Hi Everyone! I'm Nicolas Gonzalez G 👋

Welcome to my Github profile. I am a student with a lot of passion for programming. I am a person who likes to be always learning and achieving goals. Although my profile is Full Stack Web Developer, I have a strong backend orientation and that is where I have more experience.

- 📌 I'm looking to collaborate on Backend Projects.

- 🐱‍🏍 Always I try to improve my JavaScript

- 🧠 The most important thing is that I never stop learning.
